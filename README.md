 # Welcome to ShareX Documentation


 My name is Don Esrom and I am a Technical writer and Web developer.
 
 I have more than 8 years of professional writing experience. Only recently, though did I join the tech industry as a web developer. 
 
 My transition to a new career did not mean I had to abandon my first love so I simply switched to writing about Tech topics. 
 
 I aspire to work as a Technical writer for a software company. As such, I have been learning the basics of technical writing and creating samples to show what I have learnt and what I can do so far. 
 
 Part of my journey involves writing _Documentation_ for different -Apps_ and _APIs_, _Tech articles_, _Releases_, as well as learning documentation tools such as Asciidoctor, Antora and so much more. 

 You can check out my Tech articles [here](htpps://donesrom.hashnode.dev)
 

 I picked _ShareX_ because it is my favorite tool to capture screenshots when I am writing tech articles. 

 That said, I do not work for ShareX and this documentation is not in any way meant to represent them. 
 
 **This is purely a sample documentation.**
