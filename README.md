 # Welcome to ShareX Documentation
 
I aspire to work as a Technical writer for a software company. 

As such, I have been learning the basics of technical writing and creating samples to show what I have learnt and what I can do so far. 
 
Part of my journey involves writing _Documentation_ for different _Apps_ and _APIs_, _Tech articles_, _Releases_.
 
I have also been learning how to use documentation tools such as Asciidoctor, Antora and so much more. 

 
I picked _ShareX_ because it is my favorite tool to capture screenshots when I am writing tech articles. 

That said, I do not work for ShareX and this documentation is not in any way meant to represent them. 
 
 **This is purely a sample documentation.**
